# Research-Object-Certification Working Group

## Meeting Minutes 2020-07-16

Record Keeping: @kiview

### Notes

1. Discussions of limitations in using ISCC for our use case. 
Client-Side generation of an ISCC is not trivial and no current implementation exist. 
We therefore decided to proceed with BLIP-2 without ISCC at this point.
2. James presented the current state of the BLIP-2 design. 
It was decided to aggregate a set of research objects in time (hereby coined **Research Data Snapshot**) in a merkle tree and only save the merkle root to the blockchain.
Further links and documents are needed (probably stored off-chain) to resolve to the individual artifatcs (which might be public or not).
3. James and Andrei decided to proceed with the implementation of BLIP-2 to get further insights from technical realities.


### TODOs

- [ ] Update cert-issuer so that it supports VC schema (take the VC schema from cert-tools as reference) (Andrei)
- [ ] Find format of saving the certificates individual addresses (IPFS URIs)
- [ ] Explore ways how to integrate ISCC for multimedia content (Kevin)
