# Research-Object-Certification Working Group

## Meeting Minutes 2020-09-17

Record Keeping: @kiview

### Notes

- Spec (BLIP-2) 90% complete according to James
- Certification API implemented as 2 microservices
- NPM package available
- 2 Transactions for a certification necessary (generating token & updating token URI)
  - This is a drawback, but we accept it pragmatically
  - An alternative would be mutable IPFS links (there is a WIP for this, but it seems to be quite expensive)
- James demoed current implementation and workflow
- Current MVP contains HTML template for rendering cert (similar to Blockcerts)
- We will use `cryptographic identfier` as the name for the component for identifying and representing the research object in the certificate (currently a merkle root)
