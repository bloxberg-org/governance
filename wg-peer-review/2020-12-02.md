# bloxberg Peer Review Working Group Meeting
**Date:** 2 December 2020

**Participants:** 
- Tiago Paixao
- James Lawton
- Kaan Uzdogan

## Discussion 
- MPDL talked to some publishers about peer reviews. It seems traditional publishers don't find much difference between Publons and an open blockchain based PR platform. 
- Alongside James presented the DAO idea as an overarching layer for a peer review architechture. 
- Goal is to get feedback from publishers or to write a paper with them. Inputs welcome. 
- Tiago talked about a project where authors stake tokens for a manuscript to be reviewed. Publishers then have to buy tokens from researchers. Will be sharing with meeting participants. 
- The peer review infrastructure should be a community project and not belong to proprietary entities.
- How can we bring an alternative to the current journal/publisher centered reputation mechanisms?
- James: closed science --> open science --> decentralized science
- Kaan's thesis on representing PRs as Verifiable Credentials. Also looking into making use of zero knowledge proofs for closed reviews.
