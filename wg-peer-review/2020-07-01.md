# Peer-Review Working Group

## Meeting Minutes 2020-07-02

Recording Keeping: @crossoveranx

1. First goal of the working group to define the specification of the Peer Review Object specifically.
2. Metadata about peer review to be included in JSON document held offchain (probably via ERC721 Metadata extension) to be GDPR compliant. Details about schema should be pulled from existing organizations (ORCiD, cross-ref, etc).
3. Separate Peer review Registry from Peer Review Data Object in that the Peer Review Registry would be similar in function to ENS in order for all applications that want to consume the aggregated peer review data would be easily able to traverse all of the peer reviews on bloxberg.
4. Create google doc agenda for peer review working group
5. Who is able to be an endorser? Two suggestions were that reputable institutions (journals, conferences, etc) should be the only ones allowed to endorse a review. The alternative would be that any user on the platform could endorse a review to foster more social interactivity with a weighting mechanism depending on your 'reputation' (most likely previously endorsed reviews).
