# Peer-Review Working Group

## Meeting Minutes 2020-10-07

Recording Keeping: @kiview

* James had meeting with Maria from South Africa
  * Deployment of peer-review-app for all South African universities
  * Problem in South Africa with regards to targeted journals for publishing, peer-review-app can help for more transparency in peer-review
  * University requested feature to upload PDF Peer Review "Receipt"
  * Actually SHA of PDF will be persisted to the blockchain, thereby implicitly signed by the key of the user
* Dicussing using a protocol similar to OCCP to verify registered peer-reviews
* Discussing other reputation and staking systems
* Offering easy to use software to journals, to verify peer-reviews
  * Hard challenge is wallet and key management
  * Custodial wallet management as a pathway to user adoption (also Magic might help, or bloxberg MetaMask extension)
* Chance for bloxberg as de-facto standard ledger for this kind of transactions
* Are we ready for standartization of formats and protocols?
* Journals as managed list in part of Smart Contract
  * How are journals managed in the list of the smart contract (vote by consortium, other possibilities)?
